# London Underground Navigation

A Python-based navigation tool for the London Underground. This project allows users to find the shortest routes between stations, analyse route distributions, and simulate line or edge closures while maintaining network accessibility.

<br>

## Project Overview

This project is a standalone Python application for modelling and analysing the London Underground network. Users can:
- Find shortest paths between stations (by travel time or number of stops).
- Visualise distributions of travel times and route lengths.
- Simulate closures of lines or station connections while ensuring network connectivity.

The project uses custom libraries that are built with the guidelines from the book [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~akroit/math/compsci/Cormen%20Introduction%20to%20Algorithms.pdf) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.
