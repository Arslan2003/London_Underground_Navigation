# London Underground Navigation

A Python-based navigation tool for the London Underground. This project allows users to find the shortest routes between stations, analyse route distributions, and simulate line or edge closures while maintaining network accessibility.

<br>

## üìñ Overview

This project is a standalone Python application for modelling and analysing the London Underground Network. Users can:
- Find shortest paths between stations (by travel time or number of stops).
- Visualise distributions of travel times and route lengths.
- Simulate closures of lines or station connections while ensuring network connectivity.

The project uses custom libraries that are built with the guidelines from the book [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~akroit/math/compsci/Cormen%20Introduction%20to%20Algorithms.pdf) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

## üìÇ Structure

```Main.py``` is the main file which executed the algorithms to solve the given tasks:
1. Implement a route planner that finds the shortest journey time (in minutes) between two stations.
2. Modify the planner to compute the shortest route based on the number of stops instead of time.
3. Re-implement Task 2 using a different pathfinding algorithm/library.
4. Identify which station-to-station connections can be closed while keeping the network fully connected.
All other ```.py``` files implement the libraries from the book, [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~akroit/math/compsci/Cormen%20Introduction%20to%20Algorithms.pdf).
The ```London Underground data.csv``` file provide the station, station-pairs, durations, and lines in a csv format.

***Figure 1**. Most routes take between 15 to 45 minutes to complete.*

***Figure 2**. Most station pairs are 6 to 17 stations apart from each other.*

***Figure 4**. With the minimum spanning tree, most station-pairs are, now, 10 to 30 stations apart from each other - a ~70% increase.*
